DAY 3 - Client Server Architecture 

1. What is Client-Server Model?
 Client = User's browser (frontend), sends requests.
 Server = Powerful computer (backend), responds with data.
 Example: You (client) order pizza, restaurant (server) delivers it.

2. Difference between Client and Server
 Client (browser): Sends request, displays results.
 Server: Processes request, sends files/data back.

3. How HTTP Request & Response Cycle Works
 Browser sends HTTP request.
 Server receives, processes, and sends response.
 Browser displays result (HTML, CSS, etc.)

4. What Happens When You Visit a Website?
 Type URL → DNS finds server → Sends request → Server responds → Website loads.

5. Static vs Dynamic Websites
 Static: Fixed content (HTML, CSS), doesn’t change unless edited manually.
 Dynamic: Content changes automatically using server-side code + database (e.g. Facebook).
